    "\n",
    "Colaboratory, or \"Colab\", is a Jupyter Notebook hosted by Google and integrated with Google Drive. It is essentially the Google Doc version of a Jupyter Notebook. The user interface for Jupyter and Colab Notebooks differ slightly, but the core functionality is the same (Figure 1). The advantage of using Colab Notebooks is that there is no installation required and they are easier to share. Colab notebooks also leverage Google servers to perform computations and have many of the popular Scientific Python packages installed by default. \n",
